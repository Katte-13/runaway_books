# runaway_books
A website for giving away books

# Introduction
This is a training program
I have a lot of books to give away so I decided to learn some Django doing a tool for all my in spirit runaway books.

# Technologies
Python 3.7
Django 2.2

# Launch
Because is in developing mode I launch it with manager runserver

# Status
Work in progress. I still have some functionalities that doesn't work. I still need to implement the email management. 

# Trivia
The website should allow any registered user to pick the books he/she wishes and tell me that by changing the status from "cu chef de ducă" into "dorită". It is my intention to allow some other book owners to participate in this books-giving.
